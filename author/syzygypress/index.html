			<p>Sorry to announce we lost another former Atarian, <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/bradallenfuller" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=542157467&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22directed_target_id%22%3A105586892805903%7D">Brad Fuller</a>. He passed away from cancer the morning of January 2nd. Brad was a Director of Audio for Atari Inc.&#8217;s (joining in 1982), composing music and sound effects. Staying with during the transition to Atari Games, he was became Director of Engineering in 1993 before leaving Atari Games in 1996. Some of the games he did audio for include the home computer versions of Superman, Donkey Kong, E.T., Robotron as well as the coin-ops Marble Madness, Klax, S.T.U.N. Runner, Rolling Thunder, Thunderjaws, Paperboy, Xybots, Blasteroids, and 720°. The guys over at ANTIC (Randall Kindig, Kevin Savets and Brad Arnold) did a <a href="http://ataripodcast.libsyn.com/antic-episode-97-brad-fuller-composer" target="_blank">podcast</a> with him earlier last year if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about Brad Fuller&#8217;s contributions and career. Also, check out this musical <a href="https://stemage.bandcamp.com/album/where-good-marbles-go-to-die-marble-madness" target="_blank">tribute</a> to his work on Marble Madness.</p>
<p>A full listing of Brad&#8217;s voluminous contributions to video game music and audio can be seen here:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-507" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12491860_10208561620176797_4483628460976463668_o.jpg" alt="12491860_10208561620176797_4483628460976463668_o" width="2048" height="1536" /></p>
<p>The following selection of memories from those who worked with him hopefully conveys how well liked and respected Brad was:</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dennis Harper (Senior Staff Producer, Developer Atari Inc., Atari Games &#8211; <em>Liberator, Paperboy, POKEY Music System, Return of the Jedi, Toobin, Road Riot 4WD, Moto Frenzy, Primal Rage</em>)</span>: &#8220;So sad. Brad was not only a cool dude, but a legend in video game audio. I mean, didn&#8217;t he write the first FM audio fx for Marble Madness? You will be missed, my friend&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Don Diekneite (Producer / Sr. Composer / Sr. Sound Designer Atari Games )</span>: &#8220;Hey Dennis &#8211; you&#8217;re right. We had an exclusive on the Yamaha fm chip. Brad is not only considered a legend but a pioneer among game audio folks.&#8221; &#8221; I did the music to TJ. Brad did the sfx. We did a lot of games together that way.&#8221; &#8220;Rolling Thunder may have gotten new audio when it was brought over. Atari had an exclusive on the Yamaha FM chip in those days. If that was the case, Brad or Hal Canon may well have been the ones to re-do the sounds.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Rich Adam (Sr. Software Engineer Atari Inc. &#8211; <em>Missile Command, Gravitar</em> )</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad&#8217;s content and my code tricked some ears in the 80&#8217;s. He was a talented guy and a first class person. It makes me sad to think of a life cut short too soon.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Jess Melchor (Senior Product Designer Atari Inc., Atari Games &#8211; <em>720º , Toobin, Tetris</em>)</span>: &#8220;I had the chance to exchange several chats with Brad early last year. I honored his wish not to disclose his cancer battle. He was such a great person&#8230;&#8230;.truly a lover of music and of sound technology. We shared a love if vintage jazz music. Beyond those great Atati Games years, it was awesome to work around him at LBE/Silicon Entertainment. RIP my good friend&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-526" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10357263_908308329283149_1497094688986252523_n.jpg" alt="10357263_908308329283149_1497094688986252523_n" width="960" height="720" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Don Traeger (Marketing Executive Atari Inc., Electronic Arts (EA Sports) VP and producer)</span>: &#8220;Oh,<em> man. So sorry. He was such a nice man&#8230;a real gem.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Farrokh Khodadadi (Technician Atari Games &#8211; <em>Klax, Thunderjaws, Road Riot 4WD, Moto Frenzy, T-Mek &#8211; The Warlords, San Francisco Rush</em>)</span>: &#8220;Brad was the coolest manager one would be so lucky to work for. He had a way with people, if you knew him you loved him, he earned your respect. Brad had depth on so many levels, technology, art, music, theology, most of all he was a visionary. He never slowed down to rest on his laurels, always looking for a better solution. The thing I will always remember him by was his views on innovation. He believed that an innovator invents a solution before anyone presents the problem. His mantra was the lightbulb. I will miss him dearly and feel a great loss, but I sense that his spirit lives on among us. My deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Derryl DePriest (Product Marketing Manager Atari Games,Vice President, Global Brand Management at Hasbro, Inc.)</span>: <em>&#8220;Very sorry to hear. RIP Brad&#8230;.you left quite a legacy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Sandy Stan (Atari Inc.)</span>: <em>&#8220;OMG! So sorry to hear this. He was always so nice to me when I was at Atari. R IP.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bruce Merritt (Coin developer Atari Inc. &#8211; <em>Black Widow</em>)</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad was a stand-up guy &#8211; very sorry to hear that his time here was cut short.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Glen McNamara (Electronics Engineering Tech Atari Games &#8211; <em>Tetris, Badlands, S.T.U.N. Runner, Pit Fighter, Badlands, Thunderjaws, California Speed</em>)</span>: <em>&#8220;So sorry to hear this. Brad was a great guy and I have good memories of working with him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Linda Adam (Marketing Research Assistant/Product Manager Atari Games)</span>: &#8220;His soul is soaring with the angels. So sad. Brad will always have a place in my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Edward Rotberg (Senior Software Engineer Atari Inc./Atari Games &#8211; <i>Atari Baseball, BattleZone, Star Wars, Blasteroids, S.T.U.N. Runner,<br />
Shuuz, Steel Talons, Guardians of the Hood</i>)</span>: <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry to hear this. Brad was a good guy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Mary Fujihara (VP Marketing Atari Inc., Atari Games)</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad will be missed. He was a very caring person and talented in so many ways.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Mark Sherman (Field Service Manager Atari Inc., Atari Games)</span>: <em>&#8220;I worked with Brad at Atari and Silicon Entertainment Always easy to work with &#8211; Condolences to his family&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Mike Taylor (Sales VP Atari Games, Sales Manager Tengen)</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad was great to work with and added so much to all the games Boy it hard to hear of his passing, love and prayers to his family and friends.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Susan McBride (Lead Animator/Graphics/Game Design Atari Games &#8211; <em>Gauntlet, Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, Thunderjaws, Vindicators</em>)</span>: <em>&#8220;So sorry to hear this sad news about Brad. He was wonderful to work with and was such a great guy. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/561620_10153551216559213_5345097241027783791_n.jpg" alt="561620_10153551216559213_5345097241027783791_n" width="438" height="334" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dave Ralston (Game Designer/Artist Atari Inc., Atari Games &#8211; <em>Crystal Castles, Firefox, Paperboy, The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 720°, Cyberball, Rampart, Vapor TRX</em> ): </span>&#8220;I had to dig around some to find this printed photo I just knew I had. Of course, it&#8217;s not as good as I was remembering it. This was at our &#8220;grand opening&#8221; party for the skateboarding halfpipe we built in the warehouse for 720 &#8220;research.&#8221; Brad took it upon himself to throw on a tux and play bartender. Very cool. Man, those were such good times!&#8221;</p>

			<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-480" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pacman_2600box-221x300.jpg" alt="pacman_2600box" width="221" height="300" />More myths have sprung up behind the development of Tod Frye&#8217;s version of Pac-Man for the 2600 than probably any other game Atari released save Howard Scott Warshaw&#8217;s E.T. Everything from two versions existing to an extremely limited development time, and even claims of Atari changing the descriptive of Pac-Man&#8217;s foes to &#8220;ghosts.&#8221; So, we decided to get to the bottom of it all and go directly to Tod Frye himself to answer these questions.</p>
<p>First, lets understand the context of this project and place in time. It was 1981 and Atari had the license for home versions of one of the hottest arcade titles, NAMCO&#8217;s <em>Pac-Man</em>. It was to be the flagship of a new generation of games that were testing the skills of 2600 programmers to make the console dance like it never had before. How so? The 2600&#8217;s hardware was designed back when arcade game graphics were simple sprites (or &#8220;stamps&#8221; as they were called in Atari&#8217;s Coin group), and simple shapes like a tank, paddle or car. There were no complex backgrounds (playfields) to speak of either. The 2600&#8217;s purpose was to bring those sorts of mid 70s games into the home.</p>
<p>Around 1979 though, the arcade game landscape started to change drastically as microprocessor driven arcade games with more and more RAM for graphics work started using bitmapped based graphics to a greater degree than ever before. The concept of bitmaps is simple: A block of the video screen at any given moment is represented in a block of RAM composed of a bunch of zeros and ones representing the screen&#8217;s pixels. Turn a bit on and the pixel shows up rendered on the screen. Leave it at zero and nothing is there. Many games used the concept for defining and rendering individual sprites and background elements as well. Even the 2600 used a related concept by building out all the pixels on a screen on scan line by scan line basis, though it did this on the fly and separated the background and player sprites internally in its hardware.</p>
<p>What happened in the late 70s then was that as larger amounts of RAM were used (along with other advancing support hardware) the coin developers were able to represent an entire screen (called a frame) at once, so that as that frame was being drawn they could pre-render the next one and so on. All the characters, backgrounds, etc. could now be layered out like a painting and then thrown on the video screen. Though keep in mind because it&#8217;s still a computerized game it&#8217;s not quite as freeform as a painting, and placements of individual elements need to be calculated. So, the idea of a grid and what became known as &#8220;tile&#8221; or &#8220;character&#8221; graphics were commonly used. Each element that makes up a screen was pre-mapped in dimensions and laid into the screen as needed similar to how tiles are laid across a floor. Background related tiles tended to have little if any motion, while foreground tiles (like the player and its enemies) move pixel by pixel across this hidden grid.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-482" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pacman-puckman-300x288.jpg" alt="Pacman-puckman" width="300" height="288" />In the case of <em>Pac-Man</em> it&#8217;s a 28 x 36 grid of these tiles, each tile consisting of one block of 8 x 8 pixels. Need a maze corner at a certain location? The code simply references the pre-mapped graphic element stored in the game&#8217;s ROM, which the system grabs and throws into place when rendering the screen. Even more advanced, the hardware these games like <em>Pac-Man</em> were using allowed multiple colors in these tiles. Multi-colored detailed sprites and tile based graphics were just not something the 2600 was designed to do. But now these developers at Atari were being asked to create home versions of these very same bitmapped games on that unrelated hardware with far less resources.</p>
<p>And just to make it more challenging with <em>Pac-Man</em>, Tod felt it had to be a two player version as well. That meant the 128 bytes of memory (that&#8217;s bytes, not K) had to also keep track of two full mazes. So make the hardware do what it wasn&#8217;t designed for, with less resources than normal available, and do it under the already demanding schedule of a commercial product deadline.</p>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-484 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/247339_2139598091298_6296497_n-150x150.jpg" alt="247339_2139598091298_6296497_n" width="150" height="150" />How did it fall into Tod Frye&#8217;s lap? Simple, he chose it. Console game projects at that time were posted to a bulletin board in the Consumer Division developers area nicknamed &#8220;The Zoo.&#8221; Tod had been at Atari Inc. since late 1979, when he completed a version of Breakout for the soon to be cancelled LCD handheld series Atari was working on. (According to Tod it never shipped because manufacturing costs were too high). In 1980 through early &#8217;81 he completed Asteroids for the 400/800 PCS. After spending some time getting acquainted with the 2600s hardware, <em>Pac-Man</em> was to be his first project for the 2600.  After inspecting the available projects, the two newest being <em>Defender</em> and <em>Pac-Man</em>, he chose <em>Pac-Man </em>after discovering developer Bob Polaro had already been on <em>Defender</em>. The specs were challenging of course. Not only because it was a more advanced game than the 2600 was originally intended to play, but because Tod felt the project had to use the limited resources to also make this a two player game. (As Tod stated, &#8220;I just assumed it had to be a 2 player game, like the arcade. Also, i felt (and still feel) that the inclusion of a 2 player mode gave a better value to the customer, as sometimes playing 2 player is FUN!&#8221;). Now Tod had already been put on probation by his boss Dennis Koble, so he knew he was under a magnifying glass. Add to that the complexness of making the game on the 2600 hardware in even the normal project deadline and you have a strong sense of urgency building in Tod&#8217;s mind. He did it though and on time, starting in May &#8217;81 and finishing the second week of September.</p>
<p>As Tod explained to us about some of his development and design decisions on the <em>Pac-Man</em> project,  &#8220;We were still new at doing advanced arcade ports to the VCS . There was <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Asteroids</em>; both of those used their own color schemes and <em>Asteroids</em> looked and played different from the arcade. I wanted to add more color to the maze instead of black and blue, so I chose the colors. The maze was also very difficult to implement, so the exits were placed on the tops and bottoms instead of the sides. My primary focus was on the game play and making sure the game mechanics of the arcade were in the VCS title as close as could be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anticipation for <em>Pac-Man&#8217;s</em> pending release in 1982 was built up thanks to a big PR blitz from Atari. After all, this was the hottest arcade game to appear on a console since Atari had release their home version of <em>Space Invaders</em> in 1980. The game that had single handedly driven demand for the 2600 and drastically opened up the demand for new games for the console over the previous year. Marketing even planned on having the title replace the reliable Combat cartridge as the pack-in game for the 2600, assuming it would drive 2600 console sales even further into the stratosphere than they already were.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-486" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1604949_10202610850143982_865905830_n-193x300.jpg" alt="1604949_10202610850143982_865905830_n" width="193" height="300" /></p>
<p>They planned a National Pac-Man Day blitz in the U.S. for early April &#8217;82 as the official launch time for the game, something that had never been done before in the market. Stores would have lots of Pac-Man day swag to give away to pump up the fervor, and selected locations would even have Pac-Man himself there to take pictures with the kids and sign autographs. The sought after local co-ordination never happened however due to the already strong demand of the title. As stock started coming into some stores in early March of 1982, they began putting out the title and even advertising its availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-488" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1901374_10204081439307792_2075238930710554806_n-300x208.jpg" alt="1901374_10204081439307792_2075238930710554806_n" width="300" height="208" /></p>
<p>It was over the next several months that the game became the iconic contradiction that history sees it as. Sales of the game skyrocketed, eventually making it the highest selling 2600 game of all time. Yet the fact that it visually looked very dissimilar to the arcade game they had loved also troubled gamers. Granted they were happy to be playing any version at home at the time and fully expected their home versions to be more similar to the arcade ones than exact replicas. But this version just looked so different. As the third party industry exploded that summer and consumers began being deluged with more and more games fighting for a place in their homes, Atari had an issue. For the first time its name was no longer an assured seal of quality. <em>Pac-Man</em> made people cautious about seeing games with the Atari name on them as an automatic good purchase. While it did little to single handedly hurt Atari in any major way, the timing of the factors it came to represent (at a time when Atari&#8217;s overall internal issues were coming to a head that summer) have placed it in the annals of history as a symbol for the beginning of the end of Atari Inc.</p>
<p>Along with any good icon comes a slew of myths over time to explain how what happened, happened. Hence the purpose of this article. Now on with some of the myths and the presentation of the real facts&#8230;</p>
<h2>Bob Polaro passed on the project saying it couldn&#8217;t be done</h2>
<p>The myth was that Bob had originally been asked to do <em>Pac-Man</em>, but turned it down because he felt it couldn&#8217;t be done in the limited resources available for the game so he took <em>Defender</em> instead. This turns out not to be the case, as according to Bob:</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why I chose defender over Pac-Man was because I had been asked previously to design Defender, started the design, then asked if I would switch to Pac-Man. Since I always try to finish what I start, I chose to continue with Defender. It had nothing to do with technical requirements.&#8221;</p>
<h2>On claims of a 4K and 8K version existing and a rushed timeline.</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: Were you offered to move to 8K for Pac-Man towards the end of coding for it? Howard claimed that but I hadn&#8217;t heard that before.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: Nope. 8k wasn&#8217;t even an option until after Pac-Man coding was complete. I did have a meeting after Pac-Man came out, to assess the possibility of a quick revision with less flicker, if we used 8k as an option.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: So where did the claim that you originally asked for 8K come from? Can you tell me a little more about that meeting? Obviously the outcome was not to revisit it at 8K.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: It came from thin air. I never considered 8k. ROM was not really an issue, RAM was. I have a sprite reuse kernel, that would use re-position players as the screen went down. The scheduler that would minimize flicker was under consideration, would have needed some ram, and was a very tricky algorithm. Eventually I jettisoned the idea in order to get done sooner.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: You had mentioned to me previously you had the full normal dev time. As far as the rushing do you mean the pressure to get it done under the normal product deadline you mentioned you had?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: Actually, Pac-Man was done a little quickly. Not quite normal deadline. But it was a lot of work, and at times i had to stretch to get it done in a reasonable amount of time. So, while I had a tech POC for reusing sprites, i did not have a clear design for a sprite scheduler that would adapt to the position of the sprites and distribute distribute display availability fairly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: What was the reason for the slightly accelerated deadline?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: That it&#8217;s a complicated algorithm to implement with minimal RAM and ROM. My own sense of urgency.</p>
<h2>That Tod Frye held out the finished game for more money</h2>
<p>The myth goes that &#8220;Tod waited until he was 2/3rds of the way done with the Pacman coding and then marched into Ray Kassar&#8217;s office and demanded a 10 cent per cartridge royalty. Knowing that nobody else would be able to pick up the code and finish it in time, or rewrite from scratch and still make Christmas, he capitulated and Tod got Atari&#8217;s first ever royalty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth was it was Tod&#8217;s first game after joining Atari, and he wasn&#8217;t in any sort of position to have clout like that. Tod was already on probation per his annual review by Dennis Knoble, so he made sure to put in a lot of extra hours and effort on Pac-Man. He started in May &#8217;81 and finally finished the second week of September. It was after Pac-Man was done that Tod and a few others planned to go as a group to let Atari know they were planning on leaving to do 2600 games elsewhere (20th Century Fox had approached them about doing games). Tod spilled it to George Kiss who in turn let Ray Kassar know. Two days later there was a general meeting called with everyone and people were handed bonus checks, and the royalty program started right after that.</p>
<p>As Tod confirmed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pac-Man was done, wrapped, sent off for ROM mask long before the compensation was adjusted at Atari. The story that I extorted Ray has a certain cachet, but is completely bogus. I mean look, if i had the business chops to extort management for a percentage, I would have gone a lot higher that $0.10 per cart. The margin was like $25, so i would have gone for at least $1.00&#8230; more likely $2.50. Then I would have bought MicroSoft, and really rocked for 25 yrs.&#8221;</p>
<h2>On the &#8220;head of marketing&#8221; urging Ray Kassar not to release it</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s multiple versions of this claim, usually focusing on the &#8220;head of marketing&#8221; telling Kassar that nobody will want to play the game and it shouldn&#8217;t be released, giving the impression that Atari&#8217;s own marketing group had lost faith in the very product it was supposed to be championing. There&#8217;s a problem with that narrative though. It turns out the person who talked to Ray was Frank Ballouz, head of the Coin Division&#8217;s marketing department. He of course had nothing to do with the Consumer Division, and had made the comment after seeing a demonstration of the game.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: Supposedly after seeing the 2600&#8217;s soon to be released home port of Pac-Man you stated to Ray Kassar that nobody would want to play it, but you were ignored. Is that actually what happened?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Frank: Basically, yes&#8230;I think my evaluation may have been a little stronger&#8230;as many things with Ray he knew better&#8230;sort of like ET&#8230;the rest is history!!</p>
<h2>On Atari purposely overproducing Pac-Man cartridges</h2>
<p>Another prevailing myth is that Atari sought to overproduce the game from the beginning, producing more games than there were consoles. The book <em>Racing The Beam</em> even goes so far as to call it an &#8220;irresponsibly large production run of more than 10 million.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the problems with that though given the facts:</p>
<p>The production number was based on two factors: the projected number of 2600s on the market by the end of the year, and the additional amount needed as the game assumed its role as the new pack-in game for the 2600.</p>
<p>According to even the press coverage of the time, 2600 sales actually surpassed their goals and hit about 12 million units in homes by the end of the Christmas &#8217;82 season. Between that and the pack-in needs, the production amount actually turns out be a very conservative one.</p>
<h2>Atari was responsible for changing the antagonists from &#8220;monsters&#8221; to &#8220;ghosts&#8221;</h2>
<p>While certainly Atari was certainly responsible for helping to popularize the concept of Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde as being ghosts, they were not the first to begin calling them that. Some point to the fact that monsters is what appeared on the bezel instruction cards for Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and Atari was the first in public calling them ghosts. There&#8217;s a problem with that though.</p>
<p>First, Ms. Pac-Man was released in February 1982 as Keith Smith (http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.com/) confirmed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ms. Pac-Man was released around February, 1982. The DRA Price Guide, <em>RePlay </em>catalog, and <em>Play Meter </em>catalog all give a release date of February, 1982. Its release was announced in the 2/82 <em>RePlay</em>, the 2/82 <em>Vending Times</em>, and the 3/15/82 <em>Play Meter</em>. The trademark database shows a first use in commerce of 1/13/82 and a first use anywhere of 1/8/82. It was not shown at the 1981 AMOA. It might have been shown at the ATE in January, 1982, but I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because while it wasn&#8217;t on the bezel instructions, the manual (from January 1982) and flyer (also from then) for Ms. Pac-Man both use the term &#8220;ghosts.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/M/MsPac-Man.pdf</p>
<p>http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&#038;db=videodb&#038;id=707&#038;image=2</p>
<p>Also consider the fact that ghosts and monsters don&#8217;t have as much of a difference in Japan as they do in Western context:</p>
<p>http://hyakumonogatari.com/2013/11/15/whats-the-difference-between-yurei-and-yokai/</p>
<p>Finally we have <em>Pac-Man</em> creator Tōru Iwatani, who also refers to them as ghosts and &#8220;ghost shaped monsters&#8221; and explains he had ghosts in mind when creating the four of them:</p>
<p>https://programmersatwork.wordpress.com/toru-iwatani-1986-pacman-designer/</p>
<p>&#8220;Pac-Man is inspired by all the manga and animation that I’d watch as a kid. The ghosts were inspired by Casper, or Obake no Q-Taro.&#8221; &#8211; from http://www.wired.com/2010/05/pac-man-30-years/</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the elements are related to ghosts. The way the ghosts were designed, it’s not something nasty. It’s an enemy, but still somewhat amicable, lovable. &#8221; &#8211; from http://pacmanmuseum.com/history/Toru-Pac-ManCreatorSpeaks.php</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes. The relationship between PAC-MAN and the Ghosts is like Tom and Jerry’s &#8220;Fight in a friendly way . . . &#8221; PAC-MAN does not eat until he dies. It’s just a fight over the cookies, something like &#8220;Don’t eat my cookies.&#8221;&#8216;  &#8211; from http://www.onlinespiele-sammlung.de/pacman/interview2.html</p>
<h2>Tod&#8217;s Regrets</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;If i have one regret (and i have many), it is the color scheme. i truly wish i had gone for the blue maze on the black background. IIRC (and perhaps i&#8217;d &#8211; likely more so than anyone else possibly can) i was influenced by the color scheme Space Invaders used, where the &#8216;variations&#8217; used color schemes different from the arcade version.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully this clears up the most prevalent myths behind this game. A game that Tod&#8217;s fellow developers at Atari said they had nothing but respect for what he was able to accomplish back then when we interviewed them for our book. We&#8217;ll be sure to update this article though as more myths and facts are uncovered, so be sure and check back!</p>

			<p>December 31, 1946 &#8211; February 22, 2015</p>
<p>It is with a sad heart that we announce the passing of Atari legend and friend Steve Bristow this past Sunday. Steve was one of the originals, helping out on Computer Space while an intern at Ampex, moving to Nutting Associates as an intern and then taking over for Nolan there when he and Ted left to form Atari. He joined up with his ex-coworkers at Atari for a short while before being tapped to form Kee Games with Joe and Patricia Keenan. There he lead the creation of severa<span class="text_exposed_show">l ground breaking arcade games such as the full color multiplayer Indy 800 and the seminal game Tank. Upon the merger, he became VP of Engineering in the Coin Division and oversaw Atari&#8217;s Coin engineering as well as later projects like the Electronic Board Game Division and became Plant Manager Pinball Production before moving to VP Engineering in the Consumer and Home Computer Division then VP Engineering of the Consumer Game Division in the early 80s. From there he moved to VP Advanced Technology, then VP Engineering of the AtariTel Division and then finally VP Engineering of the Computer Division and Atari Fellow before leaving Atari all together in February &#8217;84. He continued on with an impressive electrical engineering career after words, but it&#8217;s his time and accomplishments (and all the fun he brought us) at Atari that are the reason we&#8217;re all here. He will be sorely missed.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Commentary by former Co-Workers:</h2>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Ted Dabney</span>: This is terrible news. Steve was a very nice guy and a good friend. I have no words to express my shock and sadness.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Loni Reeder</span>: Steve was so friendly, open, amazing, smart &#8211; and FUNNY! Those Friday nights at Khartoom&#8217;s when we&#8217;d all hang out, drink, play batgammon &#8211; I worked in Corporate &#8211; not Engineering, but Steve ALWAYS made sure that I felt included to come and hang out with the coin-op crew. I guess I was kind of &#8216;honorary coin-op&#8217; because of Steve. Because of him, I made a lot of friends &#8211; many that I still have to this day. To say he will be missed is an understatement &#8211; he was a huge part of the &#8216;heart&#8217; of Atari. I&#8217;m beyond speechless, and so very, very sad.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Elaine Shirley</span>: One of the original Atarians. I remember him well from those early days. So glad we got to visit with him at the last reunion. We lost another one today. Too many of our buddies have passed this year.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dan Kramer</span>: Steve was my Engineering VP when I started in 1980 at 1272 Borregas. Great guy; he had a late 1940s Seeburg &#8220;Trashcan&#8221; juke box! I will always remember him for his mutton chops&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bob Warne</span>: I am extremely saddened to hear of my old friend Steve passing away. I worked for Steve at Atari in many different groups as well as at Wright Communications and TIE Communications over many years and he was a great guy to work with and a great friend. I will miss him dearly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Linda Goytil</span>: Steve, I&#8217;ll always miss the days of you and Patti! I cherish those days with like it was yesterday! I give my encouragement and strength to Patti and the families for every minute possible! Thank you for being my friend!!!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Kevin Hayes</span>: Steve was an original. Great sense of fun and mischief. Sad to hear he has gone from us so young.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bob Weiss</span>: Ran across Steve not that long ago in Los Altos, always enjoyed talking with him, a unique and special guy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dan Corona</span>: I worked with Steve a couple times, Steve Bristow was a special person. I have many great memories of working with him. It&#8217;s hard to believe he is gone.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Steve Bicker</span>: I definitely remember Steve Bristow. He was an amazing talent.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Don Lang</span>: RIP, Steve. It was a pleasure working with you. Travel well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Kevin Hayes</span>: Steve was an original, unforgettable. A comparatively young man. I always enjoyed him. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Stephanie Bohannon</span>: Samaniego RIP, very nice man!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Frank Ballouz</span>: RIP, Steve&#8230;my sincere condolences to Patty, family &amp; friends!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Carol Kantor</span>: Steve was definitely a big part of the Atari Family&#8230; his legacy will be remembered.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Jerry Momoda</span>: I personally didn&#8217;t work with Steve, but know of the respect that early Atarian&#8217;s have for him. RIP Steve. Thanks for the great contributions to Atari and the game industry.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Nancy Fay</span>: Sorry to hear of this loss. Steve was definitely a genius. May God Bless his family at these times of sorrow.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Gene Albretsen</span>: So sad to hear Steves passing, I always had alot of respect for him, very special person.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Gary Cunningham</span>: I remember Steve continuing to drive his &#8217;56 Chevy to work long after he could have bought any car in the world he wanted.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Darl Davidson</span>: Steve was a true friend. we became close when we were both at Data East. See you on the back side Steve. I am sitting here in shock. This is truly a very sad day. Steve was one of a kind and did not give a crap what others thought. He was his own man. If you knew him, you loved him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bill Lapham</span>: I worked with Steve during those Golden Years. He was to say the least a huge innovator and source of true inspiration.</p>

			<p>Atari Inc. &#8211; Business Is Fun co-author Marty Goldberg will be presenting a never before seen documentary from 1973 at the Midwest Gaming Classic, Games Computers Play. Filmed by several UC Berkeley School of Journalism students during early 1973 in the San Francisco Bay Area, this film offers an unprecedented look at ground zero for arcade video games. Showing behind the scenes footage of Atari when it was first starting out along with the original Stanford AI Lab Spacewar! setup covered in Rolling Stone around the time, it remained unseen and virtually lost for decades. Discovered in one of Ralph Baer&#8217;s storage lockers by pong-story.com owner David Winter several years ago, this is the first public showing of this one of a kind film &#8211; the very first video game documentary!</p>

			<p>Nolan Bushnell is simultaneously the most inspiring and most frustrating of people. He&#8217;s directly responsible for the vision of Atari and its atmosphere, but yet has chosen to surround himself with personal marketing and stories (and this personality is most likely true of many &#8220;larger than life&#8221; figures). A good bulk of these did not survive the vetting process. One such example is presented here, and it&#8217;s a topic we continued to do exhaustive research on even after the fact. <a href="/nolan-digging-spacewar/#more-231" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

			<p>One of the biggest questions we get asked by readers after they see the wealth of information we packed into a single book, is how did we wade through it all? How did we decide what was factual enough to include and what else was just a good story? That in turn leads us to another misconception we&#8217;ve heard from some: that because some of co-founder Nolan Bushnell&#8217;s past stories and versions of events did not make it in to the book, that he was never interviewed. Nothing could be further from the truth of course, they just simply didn&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny as you&#8217;ll see in the later example in this post. <a href="/example-vetted-info/#more-169" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
