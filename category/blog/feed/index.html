				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry to announce we lost another former Atarian, <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/bradallenfuller" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=542157467&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22directed_target_id%22%3A105586892805903%7D">Brad Fuller</a>. He passed away from cancer the morning of January 2nd. Brad was a Director of Audio for Atari Inc.&#8217;s (joining in 1982), composing music and sound effects. Staying with during the transition to Atari Games, he was became Director of Engineering in 1993 before leaving Atari Games in 1996. Some of the games he did audio for include the home computer versions of Superman, Donkey Kong, E.T., Robotron as well as the coin-ops Marble Madness, Klax, S.T.U.N. Runner, Rolling Thunder, Thunderjaws, Paperboy, Xybots, Blasteroids, and 720°. The guys over at ANTIC (Randall Kindig, Kevin Savets and Brad Arnold) did a <a href="http://ataripodcast.libsyn.com/antic-episode-97-brad-fuller-composer" target="_blank">podcast</a> with him earlier last year if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about Brad Fuller&#8217;s contributions and career. Also, check out this musical <a href="https://stemage.bandcamp.com/album/where-good-marbles-go-to-die-marble-madness" target="_blank">tribute</a> to his work on Marble Madness.</p>
<p>A full listing of Brad&#8217;s voluminous contributions to video game music and audio can be seen here:</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-507" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12491860_10208561620176797_4483628460976463668_o.jpg" alt="12491860_10208561620176797_4483628460976463668_o" width="2048" height="1536" /></p>
<p>The following selection of memories from those who worked with him hopefully conveys how well liked and respected Brad was:</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dennis Harper (Senior Staff Producer, Developer Atari Inc., Atari Games &#8211; <em>Liberator, Paperboy, POKEY Music System, Return of the Jedi, Toobin, Road Riot 4WD, Moto Frenzy, Primal Rage</em>)</span>: &#8220;So sad. Brad was not only a cool dude, but a legend in video game audio. I mean, didn&#8217;t he write the first FM audio fx for Marble Madness? You will be missed, my friend&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Don Diekneite (Producer / Sr. Composer / Sr. Sound Designer Atari Games )</span>: &#8220;Hey Dennis &#8211; you&#8217;re right. We had an exclusive on the Yamaha fm chip. Brad is not only considered a legend but a pioneer among game audio folks.&#8221; &#8221; I did the music to TJ. Brad did the sfx. We did a lot of games together that way.&#8221; &#8220;Rolling Thunder may have gotten new audio when it was brought over. Atari had an exclusive on the Yamaha FM chip in those days. If that was the case, Brad or Hal Canon may well have been the ones to re-do the sounds.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Rich Adam (Sr. Software Engineer Atari Inc. &#8211; <em>Missile Command, Gravitar</em> )</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad&#8217;s content and my code tricked some ears in the 80&#8217;s. He was a talented guy and a first class person. It makes me sad to think of a life cut short too soon.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Jess Melchor (Senior Product Designer Atari Inc., Atari Games &#8211; <em>720º , Toobin, Tetris</em>)</span>: &#8220;I had the chance to exchange several chats with Brad early last year. I honored his wish not to disclose his cancer battle. He was such a great person&#8230;&#8230;.truly a lover of music and of sound technology. We shared a love if vintage jazz music. Beyond those great Atati Games years, it was awesome to work around him at LBE/Silicon Entertainment. RIP my good friend&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-526" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10357263_908308329283149_1497094688986252523_n.jpg" alt="10357263_908308329283149_1497094688986252523_n" width="960" height="720" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Don Traeger (Marketing Executive Atari Inc., Electronic Arts (EA Sports) VP and producer)</span>: &#8220;Oh,<em> man. So sorry. He was such a nice man&#8230;a real gem.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Farrokh Khodadadi (Technician Atari Games &#8211; <em>Klax, Thunderjaws, Road Riot 4WD, Moto Frenzy, T-Mek &#8211; The Warlords, San Francisco Rush</em>)</span>: &#8220;Brad was the coolest manager one would be so lucky to work for. He had a way with people, if you knew him you loved him, he earned your respect. Brad had depth on so many levels, technology, art, music, theology, most of all he was a visionary. He never slowed down to rest on his laurels, always looking for a better solution. The thing I will always remember him by was his views on innovation. He believed that an innovator invents a solution before anyone presents the problem. His mantra was the lightbulb. I will miss him dearly and feel a great loss, but I sense that his spirit lives on among us. My deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Derryl DePriest (Product Marketing Manager Atari Games,Vice President, Global Brand Management at Hasbro, Inc.)</span>: <em>&#8220;Very sorry to hear. RIP Brad&#8230;.you left quite a legacy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Sandy Stan (Atari Inc.)</span>: <em>&#8220;OMG! So sorry to hear this. He was always so nice to me when I was at Atari. R IP.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bruce Merritt (Coin developer Atari Inc. &#8211; <em>Black Widow</em>)</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad was a stand-up guy &#8211; very sorry to hear that his time here was cut short.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Glen McNamara (Electronics Engineering Tech Atari Games &#8211; <em>Tetris, Badlands, S.T.U.N. Runner, Pit Fighter, Badlands, Thunderjaws, California Speed</em>)</span>: <em>&#8220;So sorry to hear this. Brad was a great guy and I have good memories of working with him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Linda Adam (Marketing Research Assistant/Product Manager Atari Games)</span>: &#8220;His soul is soaring with the angels. So sad. Brad will always have a place in my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Edward Rotberg (Senior Software Engineer Atari Inc./Atari Games &#8211; <i>Atari Baseball, BattleZone, Star Wars, Blasteroids, S.T.U.N. Runner,<br />
Shuuz, Steel Talons, Guardians of the Hood</i>)</span>: <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry to hear this. Brad was a good guy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Mary Fujihara (VP Marketing Atari Inc., Atari Games)</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad will be missed. He was a very caring person and talented in so many ways.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Mark Sherman (Field Service Manager Atari Inc., Atari Games)</span>: <em>&#8220;I worked with Brad at Atari and Silicon Entertainment Always easy to work with &#8211; Condolences to his family&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Mike Taylor (Sales VP Atari Games, Sales Manager Tengen)</span>: <em>&#8220;Brad was great to work with and added so much to all the games Boy it hard to hear of his passing, love and prayers to his family and friends.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Susan McBride (Lead Animator/Graphics/Game Design Atari Games &#8211; <em>Gauntlet, Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, Thunderjaws, Vindicators</em>)</span>: <em>&#8220;So sorry to hear this sad news about Brad. He was wonderful to work with and was such a great guy. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/561620_10153551216559213_5345097241027783791_n.jpg" alt="561620_10153551216559213_5345097241027783791_n" width="438" height="334" /></p>

<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dave Ralston (Game Designer/Artist Atari Inc., Atari Games &#8211; <em>Crystal Castles, Firefox, Paperboy, The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 720°, Cyberball, Rampart, Vapor TRX</em> ): </span>&#8220;I had to dig around some to find this printed photo I just knew I had. Of course, it&#8217;s not as good as I was remembering it. This was at our &#8220;grand opening&#8221; party for the skateboarding halfpipe we built in the warehouse for 720 &#8220;research.&#8221; Brad took it upon himself to throw on a tux and play bartender. Very cool. Man, those were such good times!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-480" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pacman_2600box-221x300.jpg" alt="pacman_2600box" width="221" height="300" />More myths have sprung up behind the development of Tod Frye&#8217;s version of Pac-Man for the 2600 than probably any other game Atari released save Howard Scott Warshaw&#8217;s E.T. Everything from two versions existing to an extremely limited development time, and even claims of Atari changing the descriptive of Pac-Man&#8217;s foes to &#8220;ghosts.&#8221; So, we decided to get to the bottom of it all and go directly to Tod Frye himself to answer these questions.</p>
<p>First, lets understand the context of this project and place in time. It was 1981 and Atari had the license for home versions of one of the hottest arcade titles, NAMCO&#8217;s <em>Pac-Man</em>. It was to be the flagship of a new generation of games that were testing the skills of 2600 programmers to make the console dance like it never had before. How so? The 2600&#8217;s hardware was designed back when arcade game graphics were simple sprites (or &#8220;stamps&#8221; as they were called in Atari&#8217;s Coin group), and simple shapes like a tank, paddle or car. There were no complex backgrounds (playfields) to speak of either. The 2600&#8217;s purpose was to bring those sorts of mid 70s games into the home.</p>
<p>Around 1979 though, the arcade game landscape started to change drastically as microprocessor driven arcade games with more and more RAM for graphics work started using bitmapped based graphics to a greater degree than ever before. The concept of bitmaps is simple: A block of the video screen at any given moment is represented in a block of RAM composed of a bunch of zeros and ones representing the screen&#8217;s pixels. Turn a bit on and the pixel shows up rendered on the screen. Leave it at zero and nothing is there. Many games used the concept for defining and rendering individual sprites and background elements as well. Even the 2600 used a related concept by building out all the pixels on a screen on scan line by scan line basis, though it did this on the fly and separated the background and player sprites internally in its hardware.</p>
<p>What happened in the late 70s then was that as larger amounts of RAM were used (along with other advancing support hardware) the coin developers were able to represent an entire screen (called a frame) at once, so that as that frame was being drawn they could pre-render the next one and so on. All the characters, backgrounds, etc. could now be layered out like a painting and then thrown on the video screen. Though keep in mind because it&#8217;s still a computerized game it&#8217;s not quite as freeform as a painting, and placements of individual elements need to be calculated. So, the idea of a grid and what became known as &#8220;tile&#8221; or &#8220;character&#8221; graphics were commonly used. Each element that makes up a screen was pre-mapped in dimensions and laid into the screen as needed similar to how tiles are laid across a floor. Background related tiles tended to have little if any motion, while foreground tiles (like the player and its enemies) move pixel by pixel across this hidden grid.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-482" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pacman-puckman-300x288.jpg" alt="Pacman-puckman" width="300" height="288" />In the case of <em>Pac-Man</em> it&#8217;s a 28 x 36 grid of these tiles, each tile consisting of one block of 8 x 8 pixels. Need a maze corner at a certain location? The code simply references the pre-mapped graphic element stored in the game&#8217;s ROM, which the system grabs and throws into place when rendering the screen. Even more advanced, the hardware these games like <em>Pac-Man</em> were using allowed multiple colors in these tiles. Multi-colored detailed sprites and tile based graphics were just not something the 2600 was designed to do. But now these developers at Atari were being asked to create home versions of these very same bitmapped games on that unrelated hardware with far less resources.</p>
<p>And just to make it more challenging with <em>Pac-Man</em>, Tod felt it had to be a two player version as well. That meant the 128 bytes of memory (that&#8217;s bytes, not K) had to also keep track of two full mazes. So make the hardware do what it wasn&#8217;t designed for, with less resources than normal available, and do it under the already demanding schedule of a commercial product deadline.</p>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-484 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/247339_2139598091298_6296497_n-150x150.jpg" alt="247339_2139598091298_6296497_n" width="150" height="150" />How did it fall into Tod Frye&#8217;s lap? Simple, he chose it. Console game projects at that time were posted to a bulletin board in the Consumer Division developers area nicknamed &#8220;The Zoo.&#8221; Tod had been at Atari Inc. since late 1979, when he completed a version of Breakout for the soon to be cancelled LCD handheld series Atari was working on. (According to Tod it never shipped because manufacturing costs were too high). In 1980 through early &#8217;81 he completed Asteroids for the 400/800 PCS. After spending some time getting acquainted with the 2600s hardware, <em>Pac-Man</em> was to be his first project for the 2600.  After inspecting the available projects, the two newest being <em>Defender</em> and <em>Pac-Man</em>, he chose <em>Pac-Man </em>after discovering developer Bob Polaro had already been on <em>Defender</em>. The specs were challenging of course. Not only because it was a more advanced game than the 2600 was originally intended to play, but because Tod felt the project had to use the limited resources to also make this a two player game. (As Tod stated, &#8220;I just assumed it had to be a 2 player game, like the arcade. Also, i felt (and still feel) that the inclusion of a 2 player mode gave a better value to the customer, as sometimes playing 2 player is FUN!&#8221;). Now Tod had already been put on probation by his boss Dennis Koble, so he knew he was under a magnifying glass. Add to that the complexness of making the game on the 2600 hardware in even the normal project deadline and you have a strong sense of urgency building in Tod&#8217;s mind. He did it though and on time, starting in May &#8217;81 and finishing the second week of September.</p>
<p>As Tod explained to us about some of his development and design decisions on the <em>Pac-Man</em> project,  &#8220;We were still new at doing advanced arcade ports to the VCS . There was <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Asteroids</em>; both of those used their own color schemes and <em>Asteroids</em> looked and played different from the arcade. I wanted to add more color to the maze instead of black and blue, so I chose the colors. The maze was also very difficult to implement, so the exits were placed on the tops and bottoms instead of the sides. My primary focus was on the game play and making sure the game mechanics of the arcade were in the VCS title as close as could be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anticipation for <em>Pac-Man&#8217;s</em> pending release in 1982 was built up thanks to a big PR blitz from Atari. After all, this was the hottest arcade game to appear on a console since Atari had release their home version of <em>Space Invaders</em> in 1980. The game that had single handedly driven demand for the 2600 and drastically opened up the demand for new games for the console over the previous year. Marketing even planned on having the title replace the reliable Combat cartridge as the pack-in game for the 2600, assuming it would drive 2600 console sales even further into the stratosphere than they already were.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-486" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1604949_10202610850143982_865905830_n-193x300.jpg" alt="1604949_10202610850143982_865905830_n" width="193" height="300" /></p>
<p>They planned a National Pac-Man Day blitz in the U.S. for early April &#8217;82 as the official launch time for the game, something that had never been done before in the market. Stores would have lots of Pac-Man day swag to give away to pump up the fervor, and selected locations would even have Pac-Man himself there to take pictures with the kids and sign autographs. The sought after local co-ordination never happened however due to the already strong demand of the title. As stock started coming into some stores in early March of 1982, they began putting out the title and even advertising its availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-488" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1901374_10204081439307792_2075238930710554806_n-300x208.jpg" alt="1901374_10204081439307792_2075238930710554806_n" width="300" height="208" /></p>
<p>It was over the next several months that the game became the iconic contradiction that history sees it as. Sales of the game skyrocketed, eventually making it the highest selling 2600 game of all time. Yet the fact that it visually looked very dissimilar to the arcade game they had loved also troubled gamers. Granted they were happy to be playing any version at home at the time and fully expected their home versions to be more similar to the arcade ones than exact replicas. But this version just looked so different. As the third party industry exploded that summer and consumers began being deluged with more and more games fighting for a place in their homes, Atari had an issue. For the first time its name was no longer an assured seal of quality. <em>Pac-Man</em> made people cautious about seeing games with the Atari name on them as an automatic good purchase. While it did little to single handedly hurt Atari in any major way, the timing of the factors it came to represent (at a time when Atari&#8217;s overall internal issues were coming to a head that summer) have placed it in the annals of history as a symbol for the beginning of the end of Atari Inc.</p>
<p>Along with any good icon comes a slew of myths over time to explain how what happened, happened. Hence the purpose of this article. Now on with some of the myths and the presentation of the real facts&#8230;</p>
<h2>Bob Polaro passed on the project saying it couldn&#8217;t be done</h2>
<p>The myth was that Bob had originally been asked to do <em>Pac-Man</em>, but turned it down because he felt it couldn&#8217;t be done in the limited resources available for the game so he took <em>Defender</em> instead. This turns out not to be the case, as according to Bob:</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why I chose defender over Pac-Man was because I had been asked previously to design Defender, started the design, then asked if I would switch to Pac-Man. Since I always try to finish what I start, I chose to continue with Defender. It had nothing to do with technical requirements.&#8221;</p>
<h2>On claims of a 4K and 8K version existing and a rushed timeline.</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: Were you offered to move to 8K for Pac-Man towards the end of coding for it? Howard claimed that but I hadn&#8217;t heard that before.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: Nope. 8k wasn&#8217;t even an option until after Pac-Man coding was complete. I did have a meeting after Pac-Man came out, to assess the possibility of a quick revision with less flicker, if we used 8k as an option.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: So where did the claim that you originally asked for 8K come from? Can you tell me a little more about that meeting? Obviously the outcome was not to revisit it at 8K.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: It came from thin air. I never considered 8k. ROM was not really an issue, RAM was. I have a sprite reuse kernel, that would use re-position players as the screen went down. The scheduler that would minimize flicker was under consideration, would have needed some ram, and was a very tricky algorithm. Eventually I jettisoned the idea in order to get done sooner.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: You had mentioned to me previously you had the full normal dev time. As far as the rushing do you mean the pressure to get it done under the normal product deadline you mentioned you had?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: Actually, Pac-Man was done a little quickly. Not quite normal deadline. But it was a lot of work, and at times i had to stretch to get it done in a reasonable amount of time. So, while I had a tech POC for reusing sprites, i did not have a clear design for a sprite scheduler that would adapt to the position of the sprites and distribute distribute display availability fairly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: What was the reason for the slightly accelerated deadline?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tod: That it&#8217;s a complicated algorithm to implement with minimal RAM and ROM. My own sense of urgency.</p>
<h2>That Tod Frye held out the finished game for more money</h2>
<p>The myth goes that &#8220;Tod waited until he was 2/3rds of the way done with the Pacman coding and then marched into Ray Kassar&#8217;s office and demanded a 10 cent per cartridge royalty. Knowing that nobody else would be able to pick up the code and finish it in time, or rewrite from scratch and still make Christmas, he capitulated and Tod got Atari&#8217;s first ever royalty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth was it was Tod&#8217;s first game after joining Atari, and he wasn&#8217;t in any sort of position to have clout like that. Tod was already on probation per his annual review by Dennis Knoble, so he made sure to put in a lot of extra hours and effort on Pac-Man. He started in May &#8217;81 and finally finished the second week of September. It was after Pac-Man was done that Tod and a few others planned to go as a group to let Atari know they were planning on leaving to do 2600 games elsewhere (20th Century Fox had approached them about doing games). Tod spilled it to George Kiss who in turn let Ray Kassar know. Two days later there was a general meeting called with everyone and people were handed bonus checks, and the royalty program started right after that.</p>
<p>As Tod confirmed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pac-Man was done, wrapped, sent off for ROM mask long before the compensation was adjusted at Atari. The story that I extorted Ray has a certain cachet, but is completely bogus. I mean look, if i had the business chops to extort management for a percentage, I would have gone a lot higher that $0.10 per cart. The margin was like $25, so i would have gone for at least $1.00&#8230; more likely $2.50. Then I would have bought MicroSoft, and really rocked for 25 yrs.&#8221;</p>
<h2>On the &#8220;head of marketing&#8221; urging Ray Kassar not to release it</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s multiple versions of this claim, usually focusing on the &#8220;head of marketing&#8221; telling Kassar that nobody will want to play the game and it shouldn&#8217;t be released, giving the impression that Atari&#8217;s own marketing group had lost faith in the very product it was supposed to be championing. There&#8217;s a problem with that narrative though. It turns out the person who talked to Ray was Frank Ballouz, head of the Coin Division&#8217;s marketing department. He of course had nothing to do with the Consumer Division, and had made the comment after seeing a demonstration of the game.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marty: Supposedly after seeing the 2600&#8217;s soon to be released home port of Pac-Man you stated to Ray Kassar that nobody would want to play it, but you were ignored. Is that actually what happened?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Frank: Basically, yes&#8230;I think my evaluation may have been a little stronger&#8230;as many things with Ray he knew better&#8230;sort of like ET&#8230;the rest is history!!</p>
<h2>On Atari purposely overproducing Pac-Man cartridges</h2>
<p>Another prevailing myth is that Atari sought to overproduce the game from the beginning, producing more games than there were consoles. The book <em>Racing The Beam</em> even goes so far as to call it an &#8220;irresponsibly large production run of more than 10 million.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the problems with that though given the facts:</p>
<p>The production number was based on two factors: the projected number of 2600s on the market by the end of the year, and the additional amount needed as the game assumed its role as the new pack-in game for the 2600.</p>
<p>According to even the press coverage of the time, 2600 sales actually surpassed their goals and hit about 12 million units in homes by the end of the Christmas &#8217;82 season. Between that and the pack-in needs, the production amount actually turns out be a very conservative one.</p>
<h2>Atari was responsible for changing the antagonists from &#8220;monsters&#8221; to &#8220;ghosts&#8221;</h2>
<p>While certainly Atari was certainly responsible for helping to popularize the concept of Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde as being ghosts, they were not the first to begin calling them that. Some point to the fact that monsters is what appeared on the bezel instruction cards for Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and Atari was the first in public calling them ghosts. There&#8217;s a problem with that though.</p>
<p>First, Ms. Pac-Man was released in February 1982 as Keith Smith (http://allincolorforaquarter.blogspot.com/) confirmed:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ms. Pac-Man was released around February, 1982. The DRA Price Guide, <em>RePlay </em>catalog, and <em>Play Meter </em>catalog all give a release date of February, 1982. Its release was announced in the 2/82 <em>RePlay</em>, the 2/82 <em>Vending Times</em>, and the 3/15/82 <em>Play Meter</em>. The trademark database shows a first use in commerce of 1/13/82 and a first use anywhere of 1/8/82. It was not shown at the 1981 AMOA. It might have been shown at the ATE in January, 1982, but I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because while it wasn&#8217;t on the bezel instructions, the manual (from January 1982) and flyer (also from then) for Ms. Pac-Man both use the term &#8220;ghosts.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/M/MsPac-Man.pdf</p>
<p>http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&#038;db=videodb&#038;id=707&#038;image=2</p>
<p>Also consider the fact that ghosts and monsters don&#8217;t have as much of a difference in Japan as they do in Western context:</p>
<p>http://hyakumonogatari.com/2013/11/15/whats-the-difference-between-yurei-and-yokai/</p>
<p>Finally we have <em>Pac-Man</em> creator Tōru Iwatani, who also refers to them as ghosts and &#8220;ghost shaped monsters&#8221; and explains he had ghosts in mind when creating the four of them:</p>
<p>https://programmersatwork.wordpress.com/toru-iwatani-1986-pacman-designer/</p>
<p>&#8220;Pac-Man is inspired by all the manga and animation that I’d watch as a kid. The ghosts were inspired by Casper, or Obake no Q-Taro.&#8221; &#8211; from http://www.wired.com/2010/05/pac-man-30-years/</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the elements are related to ghosts. The way the ghosts were designed, it’s not something nasty. It’s an enemy, but still somewhat amicable, lovable. &#8221; &#8211; from http://pacmanmuseum.com/history/Toru-Pac-ManCreatorSpeaks.php</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes. The relationship between PAC-MAN and the Ghosts is like Tom and Jerry’s &#8220;Fight in a friendly way . . . &#8221; PAC-MAN does not eat until he dies. It’s just a fight over the cookies, something like &#8220;Don’t eat my cookies.&#8221;&#8216;  &#8211; from http://www.onlinespiele-sammlung.de/pacman/interview2.html</p>
<h2>Tod&#8217;s Regrets</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;If i have one regret (and i have many), it is the color scheme. i truly wish i had gone for the blue maze on the black background. IIRC (and perhaps i&#8217;d &#8211; likely more so than anyone else possibly can) i was influenced by the color scheme Space Invaders used, where the &#8216;variations&#8217; used color schemes different from the arcade version.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully this clears up the most prevalent myths behind this game. A game that Tod&#8217;s fellow developers at Atari said they had nothing but respect for what he was able to accomplish back then when we interviewed them for our book. We&#8217;ll be sure to update this article though as more myths and facts are uncovered, so be sure and check back!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>December 31, 1946 &#8211; February 22, 2015</p>
<p>It is with a sad heart that we announce the passing of Atari legend and friend Steve Bristow this past Sunday. Steve was one of the originals, helping out on Computer Space while an intern at Ampex, moving to Nutting Associates as an intern and then taking over for Nolan there when he and Ted left to form Atari. He joined up with his ex-coworkers at Atari for a short while before being tapped to form Kee Games with Joe and Patricia Keenan. There he lead the creation of severa<span class="text_exposed_show">l ground breaking arcade games such as the full color multiplayer Indy 800 and the seminal game Tank. Upon the merger, he became VP of Engineering in the Coin Division and oversaw Atari&#8217;s Coin engineering as well as later projects like the Electronic Board Game Division and became Plant Manager Pinball Production before moving to VP Engineering in the Consumer and Home Computer Division then VP Engineering of the Consumer Game Division in the early 80s. From there he moved to VP Advanced Technology, then VP Engineering of the AtariTel Division and then finally VP Engineering of the Computer Division and Atari Fellow before leaving Atari all together in February &#8217;84. He continued on with an impressive electrical engineering career after words, but it&#8217;s his time and accomplishments (and all the fun he brought us) at Atari that are the reason we&#8217;re all here. He will be sorely missed.</span></p>

<em>Two pictures (from the Atari Museum archive) that represent two facets of Steve as a person. On the left is Steve during an Atari staff trip to Magic Mountain in the mid 70s. On the right is Steve during a work visit to Japan (NAMCO head Masaya Nakamura to his right and Atari Japan/NAMCO-American/<wbr />Atari Games head Hideyuki Nakajima to his left) during the late 70s.</em></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Commentary by former Co-Workers:</h2>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Ted Dabney</span>: This is terrible news. Steve was a very nice guy and a good friend. I have no words to express my shock and sadness.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Loni Reeder</span>: Steve was so friendly, open, amazing, smart &#8211; and FUNNY! Those Friday nights at Khartoom&#8217;s when we&#8217;d all hang out, drink, play batgammon &#8211; I worked in Corporate &#8211; not Engineering, but Steve ALWAYS made sure that I felt included to come and hang out with the coin-op crew. I guess I was kind of &#8216;honorary coin-op&#8217; because of Steve. Because of him, I made a lot of friends &#8211; many that I still have to this day. To say he will be missed is an understatement &#8211; he was a huge part of the &#8216;heart&#8217; of Atari. I&#8217;m beyond speechless, and so very, very sad.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Elaine Shirley</span>: One of the original Atarians. I remember him well from those early days. So glad we got to visit with him at the last reunion. We lost another one today. Too many of our buddies have passed this year.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dan Kramer</span>: Steve was my Engineering VP when I started in 1980 at 1272 Borregas. Great guy; he had a late 1940s Seeburg &#8220;Trashcan&#8221; juke box! I will always remember him for his mutton chops&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bob Warne</span>: I am extremely saddened to hear of my old friend Steve passing away. I worked for Steve at Atari in many different groups as well as at Wright Communications and TIE Communications over many years and he was a great guy to work with and a great friend. I will miss him dearly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Linda Goytil</span>: Steve, I&#8217;ll always miss the days of you and Patti! I cherish those days with like it was yesterday! I give my encouragement and strength to Patti and the families for every minute possible! Thank you for being my friend!!!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Kevin Hayes</span>: Steve was an original. Great sense of fun and mischief. Sad to hear he has gone from us so young.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bob Weiss</span>: Ran across Steve not that long ago in Los Altos, always enjoyed talking with him, a unique and special guy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Dan Corona</span>: I worked with Steve a couple times, Steve Bristow was a special person. I have many great memories of working with him. It&#8217;s hard to believe he is gone.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Steve Bicker</span>: I definitely remember Steve Bristow. He was an amazing talent.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Don Lang</span>: RIP, Steve. It was a pleasure working with you. Travel well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Kevin Hayes</span>: Steve was an original, unforgettable. A comparatively young man. I always enjoyed him. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Stephanie Bohannon</span>: Samaniego RIP, very nice man!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Frank Ballouz</span>: RIP, Steve&#8230;my sincere condolences to Patty, family &amp; friends!</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Carol Kantor</span>: Steve was definitely a big part of the Atari Family&#8230; his legacy will be remembered.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Jerry Momoda</span>: I personally didn&#8217;t work with Steve, but know of the respect that early Atarian&#8217;s have for him. RIP Steve. Thanks for the great contributions to Atari and the game industry.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Nancy Fay</span>: Sorry to hear of this loss. Steve was definitely a genius. May God Bless his family at these times of sorrow.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Gene Albretsen</span>: So sad to hear Steves passing, I always had alot of respect for him, very special person.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Gary Cunningham</span>: I remember Steve continuing to drive his &#8217;56 Chevy to work long after he could have bought any car in the world he wanted.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Darl Davidson</span>: Steve was a true friend. we became close when we were both at Data East. See you on the back side Steve. I am sitting here in shock. This is truly a very sad day. Steve was one of a kind and did not give a crap what others thought. He was his own man. If you knew him, you loved him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #21759b;">Bill Lapham</span>: I worked with Steve during those Golden Years. He was to say the least a huge innovator and source of true inspiration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Atari Inc. &#8211; Business Is Fun co-author Marty Goldberg will be presenting a never before seen documentary from 1973 at the Midwest Gaming Classic, Games Computers Play. Filmed by several UC Berkeley School of Journalism students during early 1973 in the San Francisco Bay Area, this film offers an unprecedented look at ground zero for arcade video games. Showing behind the scenes footage of Atari when it was first starting out along with the original Stanford AI Lab Spacewar! setup covered in Rolling Stone around the time, it remained unseen and virtually lost for decades. Discovered in one of Ralph Baer&#8217;s storage lockers by pong-story.com owner David Winter several years ago, this is the first public showing of this one of a kind film &#8211; the very first video game documentary!</p>
<p><span id="more-270"></span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3gY0_cp8ak</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be followed by a screening of Jeff Von Ward&#8217;s The Space Invaders: In Search of Lost Time. A unique look at today&#8217;s fans of classic arcade games who are looking to preserve and in many cases recreate the glory days of arcades in their own basements and homes. This film will take you inside America’s hidden game rooms and into the hearts and minds of those who have made it their mission to enthusiastically preserve these important cultural touchstones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nolan Bushnell is simultaneously the most inspiring and most frustrating of people. He&#8217;s directly responsible for the vision of Atari and its atmosphere, but yet has chosen to surround himself with personal marketing and stories (and this personality is most likely true of many &#8220;larger than life&#8221; figures). A good bulk of these did not survive the vetting process. One such example is presented here, and it&#8217;s a topic we continued to do exhaustive research on even after the fact.<span id="more-231"></span></p>
<p>One of the very first claims we had to vet for the book is when and where Nolan saw <em>Spacewar!</em> for the first time. Besides being important for accuracy, it also sets up the context for several other events and claims, most notably his work relationship with Ted Dabney and his testimony during the <em>Magnavox vs. Atari et al.</em> trial where he used this and other claimed experiences at University of Utah to establish an earlier start date to Ralph Baer and company.</p>
<p><em>The claim:</em> Nolan has stated he first played <em>Spacewar!</em> at the University of Utah, on a PDP-1 there in &#8217;65 or &#8217;66, sometimes doing all night gaming sessions on it. Nolan was an undergrad in Electrical Engineering at the time. In court testimony during the 70s he also claimed it was either a UNIVAC 1108 or IBM 794. In even later interviews (such as DeMaria and Wilson&#8217;s <em>High Score</em>) he claims it was played on various IBM equipment. So right away, we&#8217;re faced with conflicting equipment claims.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s three things that need to be immediately sorted out: what equipment Utah actually had during that timeframe, whether it was possible for it to run <em>Spacewar!</em> and whether a port of <em>Spacewar!</em> had even been done for it.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-249" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/spacewarscreen_museum-300x204.jpg" alt="spacewarscreen_museum" width="300" height="204" />First, some background history: <em>Spacewar!</em> was of course written at MIT by Steve &#8220;Slug&#8221; Russell and several other MIT undergrads, with the first iteration completed in February 1962. In these days, software was hardware specific and even more so in regards to the display. <em>Spacewar</em>! was written specifically for the DEC PDP-1 with a Type 30 display (a point plotting CRT display that&#8217;s part of the operator console). It&#8217;s code was in assembly, saved on a paper tape stored in a drawer by the operator console. As MIT&#8217;s PDP-1 was the first one (considering DEC&#8217;s founders were MIT grads as well and the offices were in the vicinity), the undergrads that coded it had a unique timing and location opportunity allowing DEC&#8217;s founders to see the game early on. They decided to use <em>Spacewar!</em> as a promotional tool for the PDP-1&#8217;s capabilities and later as test software for new PDP-1s. (Note that only about 55 PDP-1s were ever produced, so it&#8217;s not like there were hundreds of copies of the game making it&#8217;s way around). The game would be started up before shipping the PDP-1, shut down, and then restarted once the PDP-1 was installed at it&#8217;s new location. If it played properly, then the PDP-1 had survived shipping.</p>
<p>This sets up some immediate requirements for someone to have played a copy of <em>Spacewar!</em> up through the mid 1960s.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) They&#8217;d need a PDP-1 with a Type 30 display.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) If they were going to consider porting it, they&#8217;d need to take the original 18-bit PDP-1 assembly code and port it the new computer or write a new version from scratch (based on memory after playing the PDP-1 game), both of which would still require a mainframe or minicomputer with a plotting or vector display.</p>
<h1>Tracking the PDP-1</h1>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-251" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dec-pdp-1-300x233.jpg" alt="dec-pdp-1" width="300" height="233" />Luckily, there was a finite amount of PDP-1s produced (about 55 over it&#8217;s limited lifetime). We&#8217;ll start with Bitsavers&#8217; copy of DEC&#8217;s own serial numbers list (<a title="PDP-1 Serial Numbers" href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp1/PDP-1_SerialNumbers.pdf" target="_blank">http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp1/PDP-1_SerialNumbers.pdf</a>). As you can see, Utah is not on the list. Given that a few serial numbers are in question in this version of the listing, we followed up with former DEC mainstay Gordon Bell. Gordon was a co-designer of the PDP-1 and developed the followup PDP-4 and PDP-6. We asked him if he knew if Utah had a PDP-1 and (as a side note), in the process verifying the story about DEC shipping PDP-1s with <em>Spacewar!</em> pre-installed. His response:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they had a PDP-1, but I can&#8217;t be certain. Records at the Computer History Museum Digital files might show all the machines.</p>
<p>As far as shipping with Spacewar!, that sounds quite plausible, however not all machines had the scope.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason that it shouldn&#8217;t run when powered up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So this is a semi-verification on Utah not having a PDP-1, and another interesting note: not every PDP-1 made had the point plotting display (scope) required to play the game.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-252" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DavidEvans.png" alt="DavidEvans" width="207" height="300" />Our next step is to go through Utah&#8217;s own archives to see what equipment they had in 1965 as Nolan entered the University of Utah. With the assistance of Sarah Bell (<a href="http://faculty.utah.edu/u0261171-SARAH_ANN_BELL/biography/index.hml" target="_blank">a graduate teaching assistant in the College of Engineering</a> and winner of a <a href="http://writing-program.utah.edu/fellowship.php" target="_blank">fellowship from the National Association for Computing Machinery History Division for the documentation of Utah&#8217;s legendary computer graphics research under Evans and Sutherland</a>) we were able to find the answer quickly. For those not familiar, David Evans was the founder of University of Utah&#8217;s computer science department (which he was recruited to start in 1965). He lured MIT computer graphics researcher Ivan Sutherland to Utah in 1968 and the duo performed research in 2D and 3D graphics that became the foundation for the field.</p>
<p>Right now, we&#8217;re primarily interested in 1965/1966, which is when Nolan has claimed in some variants of his story that he played it on either a PDP-1 or IBM mainframe. Evans&#8217; research was just getting started at this time and in fact he was at the early stages of procuring equipment. Thankfully, he documented everything in his progress reports required by the grant he was given for his research on &#8220;Graphical Man-Machine Communications&#8221;. Specifically, this one document from November 30, 1966 states exactly what equipment was there at that time and what had been there previously:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Computer Center has replaced the IBM Type 7044 computer<br />
by a UNIVAC Type 1108 computer and has undertaken the system<br />
programming required to interface with the graphics laboratory.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Nov 30, 1966 Evans Notes, University of Utah" href="http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/ref/collection/uspace/id/1249" target="_blank">http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/ref/collection/uspace/id/1249</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So no PDP-1. However, it does detail when the special graphics display that Nolan had mentioned playing the game on (the &#8220;kludge&#8221;) was first being developed. Also note that it was a &#8220;half-tone&#8221; or raster graphics display (which would later be used in the 3D graphics research), making it extremely unlikely it was used for <em>Spacewar!</em> even after it was developed (the reason why the raster based &#8220;half-tone&#8221; display wouldn&#8217;t have worked well is described in more detail in the &#8220;Tracking <em>Spacewar!</em>&#8221; section).</p>
<p>What the notes also list is a PDP-8 which had recently arrived along with a special &#8220;Line Graphics Terminal&#8221; or vector display. This looks more promising as a possible lead for playing <em>Spacewar!</em>, at least until it&#8217;s stated that the PDP-8 was being used as a graphics buffer for the UNIVAC and that the system would only be able to use one display at a time. Even so, we checked out the possibility of a PDP-8 Spacewar! in this timeframe, which we&#8217;ll discuss later in the section on &#8220;Tracking <em>Spacewar!</em>&#8220;. In the meantime though, let&#8217;s look at the IBM computer that was replaced.</p>
<p>In several versions of Nolan&#8217;s claim, he&#8217;s stated he played it on an IBM mainframe of some sort. For Russel Demaria&#8217;s book <em>High Score</em>, Nolan stated &#8220;[<em>Spacewar!</em>] was running on an IBM 7900 or something like that. A big IBM machine. Certainly too expensive to be feasible economically.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the March 2nd, 1976 deposition of Nolan Bushnell (Magnavox vs. Bally, et al.), Nolan was questioned about his experiences with computer games at the University of Utah. Below is an excerpt from that testimony. Note that these statements were made under oath in a court of law and were made within about a decade of Nolan&#8217;s attendance at University of Utah, when his memory would have been fresher:</p>
<blockquote><p>MR. ANDERSON: Q. Mr. Bushnell, in your testimony in January you referred to a Jim Davis or someone with a name like that and then referred to him as Jim D. Have you determined with any great specificity who that individual was?</p>
<p>A. No, I haven&#8217;t. In fact, I&#8211; No.</p>
<p>Q. This was an individual who you said showed you a game being played on a computer at the University of Utah; am I correct?</p>
<p>A. That&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p>Q. Have you made any effort to determine who that individual was?</p>
<p>A. Yes, I have.</p>
<p>Q. What have you done in that regard?</p>
<p>A. I went to the university and went through the rogues&#8217; gallery.They have a listing of the graduates for each school year. I attempted to match a face with a name.</p>
<p>Q. Did you personally go to the university and do that?</p>
<p>A. Yes, I did.</p>
<p>Q. Where is the rogues&#8217; gallery maintained at the University of Utah?</p>
<p>A. On the second floor in front of the Electrical Engineering department.</p>
<p>Q. In what office or department?</p>
<p>A. It&#8217;s in the hallway. It&#8217;s actually right in front of the computer center.</p>
<p>Q. Did you do anything else to try to establish who Jim D. was?</p>
<p>A. Yes , I did.</p>
<p>Q. What else did you do?</p>
<p>A. I talked to some of the people in the computer center attempting to find some people that had been around at approximately the same time.</p>
<p>Q. Were you able to find anyone?</p>
<p>A. No, I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember anyone that you talked to at the University of Utah in your effort to establish who Jim D. was, or anyone else who was around at that time?</p>
<p>A. Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Q. To whom did you talk in your investigation?</p>
<p>A. Professor Carl Durney.</p>
<p>Q. How do you spell that? A. D-u-r-n-e-y.</p>
<p>Q. Anyone else?</p>
<p>A. I wrote the names down. I&#8217;ve got two names here and I talked to one of them and was referred to the other one and I&#8217;m not sure which one was which. One was a guy named Bob Pendleton, and another was a guy named Dennis Stansfield and I don&#8217;t remember which one I talked to and which one was referred to by the other. I was unable to contact the<br />
other fellow.</p>
<p>Q. When did you make this trip?</p>
<p>A. It was in the middle of January.</p>
<p>Q. Of 1976?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Sometime shortly after the deposition.</p>
<p>Q. Did you prepare any report on your trip?</p>
<p>A. No, I did not.</p>
<p>Q. Any memoranda of any kind?</p>
<p>A. No, I did not.</p>
<p>Q. Were you able to find&#8211;</p>
<p>A. Well, memoranda? I wrote the names down in my notebook here.</p>
<p>Q. Nothing other than that?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Were you able to find any document that would support your testimony concerning Jim Davis showing you a game played on a computer at the University of Utah in 1965?</p>
<p>A. No .</p>
<p>Q. Did you find any documentation that would support your testimony that a game was played on a computer at the University of Utah in 1965?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Did you find anything other than documents tangible, that would support your testimony that a game was played on a computer at the University of Utah in 1965?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. What did you find that was tangible?</p>
<p>A. Oh, tangible?</p>
<p>Q. Yes.</p>
<p>MR. HERBERT: Define what you mean by tangible, Counsel.</p>
<p>MR. ANDERSON: Q. Physical. Something that you could bring back with you or that we could go see there.</p>
<p>A. Excuse me just a second . No.</p>
<p>MR. ANDERSON: Let the record show that you have had a conference with Mr. Herbert on the subject.</p>
<p>MR. HERBERT: The conference with Mr.. Herbert was with respect to your definition of tangible and what it is you actually wanted.</p>
<p>MR. ANDERSON: Q. In your earlier testimony you indicated that you weren&#8217;t certain whether the computer was a UNIVAC 1108 or an IBM 794 that you saw a game played on. Do you know which of those two it was?</p>
<p>A. No, I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Q. Did you make any effort to find out at the University of Utah?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Did you make any effort to find out what computer was at the University of Utah in 1965 at the time you say you saw a game played on a computer there?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. You testified, I think, that about a year later you again had contact with a game played·on a computer at the University of Utah?</p>
<p>A. Correct.</p>
<p>Q. And that you had had to the best of your knowledge no contact with a game played on a computer in the interim between those two events; is that correct?</p>
<p>A. That&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p>Q. The second event that you referred to, have you been able to establish when that occurred specifically?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Do you believe that it was in 1966 or 1967 or do you have a belief?</p>
<p>A. I believe it was in &#8217;66.</p>
<p>Q. You mentioned in that particular context a Randall Willey, W-i-l-l-e-y.</p>
<p>A. Willey.</p>
<p>Q. Have you been in touch with Mr. Willey since your last testimony?</p>
<p>A. No, I have not.</p>
<p>Q. Have you made an effort to find Mr. Willey?</p>
<p>A. Yes, I have.</p>
<p>Q. Have you succeeded?</p>
<p>A. No, I have not.</p>
<p>Q. Do you know his present location?</p>
<p>A. No, I do not.</p>
<p>Q. What effort did you make to find Mr. Randall Willey?</p>
<p>A. I called a couple of my fraternity brothers.</p>
<p>Q. What else?</p>
<p>A. That&#8217;s the extent.</p>
<p>Q. You testified that you obtained a listing of a program from Randall Willey; is that correct?</p>
<p>A. I don&#8217;t remember whether it was from Randall or whether one of the other guys. I don&#8217;t really remember. I got the lisiting from either him or one of the guys that he named.</p>
<p>Q. Was that listing in some machine language of a particular machine?</p>
<p>A. Yes, it was.</p>
<p>Q. What machine?</p>
<p>A. You mean what machine or what language?</p>
<p>Q. What machine?</p>
<p>A. I don&#8217;t remember. It relates to the IBM versus UNIVAC problem.</p>
<p>Q. It&#8217;s the same problem? It was one of those two; is that your testimony?</p>
<p>A. The languages for either machine are &#8212; I mean, it wasn&#8217;t in the language that it was written in I think is the basic language that crosses computer types.</p>
<p>Q. In what language do you say that listing was that you obtained from Randall Willey or someone?</p>
<p>A. It was a higher-level language. I don&#8217;t remember whether it was FORTRAN or ALGOL. I understood it so it should have been one of those two.</p>
<p>Q. I understand that there is more than one FORTRAN; is that true?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Which FORTRAN do you think it might have been in?</p>
<p>A. I have no idea.</p>
<p>Q. I believe you testified that you did not know anything about ALGOL<br />
until after you had taken two computer courses at the University of<br />
Utah; is that right?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. What were they, EE-75 and 175?</p>
<p>A. I believe those were the numbers.</p>
<p>Q. Have you established when you took those courses?</p>
<p>A. No. When I get my transcript I will have that established.</p>
<p>Q. You testified also that there was some type of display used with the computer that you saw on the two occasions at the University of Utah when you played a game on it. Do you now know what the display was?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Did you make any effort to check the records of the University of Utah to see what they had in the way of equipment in the critical period of &#8217;65, &#8217;66 or &#8217;67?</p>
<p>A. No, I did not.</p>
<p>Q. Is there any other information of any kind that you gained during your trip to Utah or from any other source since your last testimony with respect to that early activity of yours in 1965 at the University?</p>
<p>A. I just gained the basic statement that, yes, games were still being played at the University of Utah in great abundance.</p>
<p>Q. Well, from whom did you obtain that statement?</p>
<p>A. The fellow I talked to. One of those two. I should have written it down, you know, which guy I talked to.</p>
<p>Q. Well, the fellow that you talked to whose name you can&#8217;t remember I gather from your testimony was not there at the critical time?</p>
<p>A. Right.</p>
<p>Q. All right. Any other information?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. When you obtained this listing that you have referred to from Mr. Willey in what physical form was that, cards or fanfold or &#8212;</p>
<p>A. Fanfold.</p>
<p>Q. I think your testimony was that you made some changes the program represented by that listing?</p>
<p>A. Correct.</p>
<p>Q. Physically how did you make those changes?</p>
<p>A. In the margin of the listing in parentheses.</p>
<p>Q. What did you do with the listing with those changes on it?</p>
<p>A. Gave it to the guy who was a custodian and asked him to implement them.</p>
<p>Q. Is it your testimony that he did implement them?</p>
<p>A. Yes, he did.</p>
<p>Q. How did he implement them?</p>
<p>A. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him implement them?</p>
<p>A. No, I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that he did implement them?</p>
<p>A. I saw the results.</p>
<p>Q. How did you observe the results?</p>
<p>A. On the face of the screen.</p>
<p>Q. What was the physical form of the program when it was put into the machine?</p>
<p>A. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Q. Was it punchcards?</p>
<p>A. That was the normal thing. I don&#8217;t know what it actually was.</p>
<p>Q. When you say that it was the normal thing, that was the normal<br />
thing for what.</p>
<p>A. Well, see, there are three or four ways you can access a machine. You can do it with punchcards. You can keep the whole program stored in core or on tape. If it&#8217;s a minor change sometimes you just have a listing on the terminal and you make the editing on the program and store it in the computer. I don&#8217;t know what was used in this instance. If it&#8217;s a permanent change generally you change the card deck and that way you can put it in a file and in case the computer bombs you don&#8217;t lose your program. If it&#8217;s stuck in the core and the computer goes down, then you would have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what input peripherals existed with respect to the computer that you say you used at the University of Utah?</p>
<p>A. Well basically there were card readers, alphanumeric tele-typewriters. There were, you know, card punches. It had a lot of tape storage, a lot of disc storage, a lot of core. It had the whole McGill.</p>
<p>Q. I think you testified that after you made this change in the program you played a game on the University of Utah computer for a period of time thereafter?</p>
<p>A. Correct.</p>
<p>Q. And then for a subsequent period you did not play a game on the computer until the time you left the University of Utah?</p>
<p>A. That&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p>Q. What was the first period when you played and then how long was the period between the time you stopped playing any game on the computer and you left the University of Utah?</p>
<p>A. Well, it was a matter that somebody fouled the computer up one time playing games so that the University really clamped down in it. So it was not a matter of not wanting to, it was a matter of just not being allowed to. I don&#8217;t remember exactly the time frame. I think the space was about one-quarter that I played several times and then subsequent<br />
to that from that time until the time I left there was no more game playing.</p></blockquote>
<p>So according to this testimony now, Nolan claims <em>Spacewar!</em> was played on either a UNIVAC 1108 or an IBM 794. Likewise now the claim is expanded to the port of <em>Spacewar!</em> he playing being coded either in FORTRAN or ALGOL, two high level languages it would have been very unlikely to have ported the game over to in those days of limited system resources (which we&#8217;ll go over in the Tracking <em>Spacewar!</em> section). We already have established the 1108 had first arrived in November of &#8217;66 and was immediately appropriated for the research and special hardware expansion, both factors making it impossible to have played that game on it in 1965 or 1966. Giving the benefit of the doubt that he meant the IBM 7044, which was available at Utah through 1966 until it was replaced by the 1108, let&#8217;s look further at the capabilities of this machine.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-253" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IBM7040-279x300.jpg" alt="IBM7040" width="279" height="300" />The IBM 7040 series the 7044 is a part of was introduced by IBM in 1963 (though it was originally designed in 1961) and was on the market for two years before it was replaced by the legendary IBM 360. The 7040 did not have a graphical display available for it. All I/O was through punchcards, magnetic tape, or the accompanying teletype machine (<a title="IBM 7040" href="http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/7040/A22-6649-4_7040princOps.pdf" target="_blank">http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/7040/A22-6649-4_7040princOps.pdf</a>). This once again makes it impossible to have played <em>Spacewar!</em> on, or any other computer based games other the possibility of turn based text based games.</p>
<p>And what of the UNIVAC 1108/PDP-8 research system starting construction in late 1966? It was constantly involved in very slow, methodical incremental research all of which is documented in Evans&#8217; notes such as :</p>
<p><a title="Evans Notes" href="http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/uspace/id/2332/rec/5" target="_blank">http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/uspace/id/2332/rec/5</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a title="Evans Notes" href="http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/uspace/id/4973/rec/4" target="_blank">http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/uspace/id/4973/rec/4</a></p>
<p>Note that we&#8217;re not interested in any of the reports past 1968, since that&#8217;s when Nolan graduated from Utah and moved out to California to work at Ampex. This is also despite the fact even going to 1968 is giving even more benefit of the doubt, since the claimed time period was &#8217;65-&#8217;66. Regardless, as is clearly shown by the documentation (of which more is available in the Utah archives), by February of 1968 Evans was still involved in the research of getting the system to display basic shapes on the &#8220;kludge&#8221; and vector displays. This once again makes it highly unlikely that at any point it would have been appropriated to play <em>Spacewar!</em> for an undergrad EE student. And as Sarah has verified, there is zero mention of <em>Spacewar!</em> in any of the archive documentation.</p>
<h1>Tracking <em>Spacewar!</em></h1>
<p>All roads start at the PDP-1, the platform that <em>Spacewar!</em> was specifically created on and tied to. For the game code to spread to other platforms from there, you&#8217;d need two qualifications:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) The original PDP-1 18-bit code to somehow alter for the new platform.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) A point plotting or vector display.</p>
<p>The importance of these two qualifications is simply an unequivocal fact. In point plotting and vector computer displays, the software is directly controlling the beam to draw the shapes on the screen. That means the code is uniquely tied to the hardware it&#8217;s running on. To play the actual <em>Spacewar!</em> game, from 1961 to 1965, you&#8217;d need a PDP-1. So when did the <em>Spacewar!</em> make it&#8217;s jump off the PDP-1?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-255" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/SAIL-1968-300x198.png" alt="SAIL 1968" width="300" height="198" /></p>
<p>For that we went to the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) and two important people involved with the lab: former SAIL Executive Officer Les Earnest and <em>Spacewar!</em>&#8216;s creator Steve &#8220;Slug&#8221; Russell. Why start at Stanford? That&#8217;s the place where Nolan took Ted Dabney to see <em>Spacewar!</em> running at in 1969 and the place where <em>Spacewar!</em> creator Steve Russell had moved to after leaving MIT&#8217;s labs for a brief stint at Harvard. The lab had been started by former MIT professor John McCarthy in 1963 and then moved to it&#8217;s historic DC Power Station location which formerly opened on June 6, 1966. They already had a copy of <em>Spacewar!</em> running on their PDP-1, but in that same month, they also received a PDP-6. A 36-bit computer, the PDP-6 made the porting of the 18-bit PDP-1 code a bit easier &#8211; which Steve did in late 1966. As Les explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was actually in late 1966, done principally by Steve Russell with some help from others.</p>
<p>The PDP-6 at that point was a timesharing system running a flock of Model 33 Teletypes and with zero storage &#8211; all stations used a DECtape unit for i/o and storage. Whereas the original Spacewar! ran on a PDP-1 with no competition, when it was initially run under the PDP-6 timesharing system on the operator console it ran unevenly, depending on system load. To get around that, system hackers created a real time service called &#8220;Spacewar! mode&#8221; that allowed programs to get serviced at a specified multiple of 1/60th of a second, which was used to make the rockets move smoothly.</p>
<p>Spacewar! mode turned out to have a number of useful applications including synthesizing music and debugging hardware using an oscilloscope. Of course it could also easily be abused, which could bring the system to its knees, but whenever that happened the wizards would quickly figure out who was doing it and go beat up on them.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that information, we now have the first verifiable port of <em>Spacewar!</em>. Further ports of the game to DEC hardware appear in the very early 70s as verified by the DECUS catalogs (DEC&#8217;s official catalog of available software for the platforms, which was primarily community driven). This includes the PDP-7, PDP-8, PDP-10 and PDP-12. We further verified with Les that the PDP-10 version was a port of the PDP-6 version.</p>
<p>While Nolan and Ted were working on <em>Computer Space</em>, Bill Pitts ported a version of the <em>Spacewar!</em> code to the just released 16-bit PDP-11/20 in &#8217;71. Placed inside a coin-operated cabinet, it started it&#8217;s run at Stanford around the time Nolan and Ted were testing <em>Computer Space</em>.</p>
<p>Likewise, the 1977 arcade version of the game (<em>Space Wars</em>) by Larry Rosenthal and Cinematronics also ran the actual computer game. In this case Larry had created a hardware emulation of the PDP-8 and licensed the PDP-8 version of the game from MIT for commercial use. All of these are of course outside the timeframe in question though.</p>
<p>What that does leave us to cover though are the &#8220;inspired by&#8221; versions such as Nolan and Ted&#8217;s <em>Computer Space</em>. These versions of the game, while not based on the actual code, were certainly meant to impart a version of the game. &#8220;Inspired by&#8221; versions of the game were created on the Imlac PDS-1 vector graphics computer for example, whose PDS-1 display was released in 1970.</p>
<p>Even earlier there was the version of <em>Spacewar!</em> shown on the Data General NOVA Data at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. (Ironic given Nolan and Ted first considered doing <em>Computer Space</em> on this computer but chose not to because it&#8217;d be too cost prohibitive for use in mass produced coin-ops). Founded by two ex-DEC employees, Data General was showing off it&#8217;s new NOVA computer due to be released the following year. Creating a version of the game to run on the NOVA&#8217;s &#8220;spacious&#8221; 5&#8243; Tektronix Type 602 vector display they showed it off, though it was probably far overshadowed by Douglas Engelbart doing his &#8220;mother of all demos&#8221; at the same show (introducing the concept of GUI based computing with a mouse among other things).</p>
<p>Lastly, Steve Russell informed us that &#8220;Jim Burroughs wrote a version for the IBM 1620, one of the slowest computers of its day. The output was on a Calcomp plotter, and the version was not playable because of it&#8217;s excruciatingly slow pace.&#8221;</p>
<h1>In Conclusion</h1>
<p>So we&#8217;re left with the fact that in the claimed time period of &#8217;65-&#8217;68 there was no equipment available at Utah during &#8217;65 and &#8217;66 for playing the PDP-1 version, and no available equipment for playing the PDP-6 version from &#8217;66-&#8217;68. Nor was the IBM 7044 the University of Utah replaced in &#8217;66 capable of running a graphics display. The PDP-8 version had not been created yet, and even then the PDP-8 on location at the university was immediately tied in to the UNIVAC 1108 as a graphics buffer and display controller. Finally, with how system resource-intensive the game was, it would be highly unlikely it was ever done in a high level programming language like FORTRAN at this time (every other known version from the 1960s was done directly in assembly).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in several interviews, Ted Dabney was adamant that Nolan did not see <em>Spacewar!</em> until he went to the SAIL lab in &#8217;69 and saw it there, bringing Ted back with him to see it as well. What&#8217;s more, the given facts seem to support this. We&#8217;re left with one final bit of evidence that supports this as well, Nolan himself:</p>
<div class="rve" data-content-width="625"><iframe width="625" height="352" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/p3gY0_cp8ak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><!-- Responsive Video Embeds plugin by www.kevinleary.net --></p>
<p>From the documentary <em>Games Computers Play</em> and filmed in early 1973, it&#8217;s the earliest known video interview of Nolan. Only a short five years after graduating from Utah, one would expect his memory to be very fresh when he states here he first saw it at Stanford. It&#8217;s also importantly pre-Magnavox lawsuit. When Magnavox filed it&#8217;s lawsuit against Atari and several other companies in April 1974 over the early landmark patents of &#8220;video games,&#8221; the &#8220;I saw it in Utah&#8221; claim started to appear. This leaves us to wonder if the change in story was coincidence or simply part of the long ongoing feud between Nolan and Ralph Baer that has resulted in Nolan constantly changing various stories to put himself earlier. The fact that it&#8217;s a tactic seen frequently in Nolan&#8217;s interviews over the last several decades, seems to point to the later. An example is it&#8217;s more recent application towards Ted and Ted&#8217;s development of the spot motion circuitry.</p>
<p>In recent interviews Nolan has expanded his backstory to claim that he was fixing televisions as a 10 year old (such as hist interview at the Startup Grind conference in Mountain View in February 2013 &#8211; <a title="Nolan Bushnell Startup Grind Interview" href="http://startupgrind.com/event/startup-grind-silicon-valley-hosted-nolan-bushnell-atari-chuck-e-cheese/" target="_blank">http://startupgrind.com/event/startup-grind-silicon-valley-hosted-nolan-bushnell-atari-chuck-e-cheese/</a>). On it&#8217;s own, it seems an interesting tidbit of info. That is until more of its context was provided through an email exchange between Devin Monnens (Assistant Course Director of Game History at Full Sail University and former Adjunct Professor at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs teaching Game Design and Critical Game Studies) and Nolan dated June 3, 2013. Devin had emailed Nolan asking him about what sort of technical background not mentioned in Steve Kent&#8217;s book <em>The Ultimate History of Video Games</em> would have contributed to his success as an inventor and game designer as well as Nolan and Ted&#8217;s inspirations in creating the spot-motion circuitry for <em>Computer Space</em>. Specifically the passage from Business Is Fun where Nolan asks Ted, &#8220;Why did the vertical hold button on the television move the screen up and down?&#8221; Nolan provided this response:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are numerous inaccuracies in &#8220;Business is Fun&#8221;. Curt and Marty have rewritten history in several instances. I was repairing television sets when I was 10 so I knew exactly what vertical hold did. I never asked Ted that&#8230;.in fact I did 100% of the digital engineering myself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Devin presented us with Nolan&#8217;s claim to verify its accuracy, and not wanting for Devin to just take our word for it (even knowing he knew the research we had done and our research methodology as presented in the last blog post), we directly brought Ted into the email discussion with Devin. Ted once again presented his side and details (including about their early partnership involving pizza parlors and not video games), and called the TV repair story bunk and that there&#8217;s no way a child of 10 or 11 could safely remove dangerous high voltage picture tubes by himself. He also CC&#8217;d Nolan directly on the response, bringing Nolan into this email conversation, to which Nolan responded on June 6 with the following in regards to the TV repair story:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By the time I was 13 I had a full amateur setup costing more than couple of month of adult pay. The money had to come from some where. My folks didn&#8217;t have that kind of money.</p>
<p>The only logical way that I could have made that much money at that age 11,12,13 was through some sort of entrepreneurial activity.</p>
<p>Which is easier to believe:</p>
<p>1. Nolan was interested in everything electrical and loved ham radio and purchased the hundreds of dollars of parts by fixing TV&#8217;s for his own little company and later for Barlow Furniture (The only appliance and furniture store in Clearfield) throughout high school adding washing machines to his list of skills.</p>
<p>2. Nolan was interested in only ham radio and drew the line at TV sets. They were too scary and had way too much voltage. He would pay for his transmitters through working endless hours at odd jobs in a world of $.50 cents per hour and clearly not do anything entrepreneurial it is just not who he is. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ted&#8217;s response seemed to once again provide a different light to Nolan&#8217;s new claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First of all, Nolan never was &#8220;repairing television sets&#8221;. This is something he just made up to support the other stories he tells. A 10 year old would need a lot of help to replace a picture tube. They have a lethal voltage even when they&#8217;re removed from the TV. Changing vacuum tubes in TV sets in 1953 was not an easy job. You would have to know what the problem is and which tubes may cause it. Sometimes a burned out filament can give you a clue but too many had the filaments wired in series. Only the glass tubes could give you a hint (12BA6 Remote-cutoff pentode) but the metal ones couldn&#8217;t (6F6 Power pentode) which were sometimes used to drive the deflection yokes. I did a lot of this when I lived on Shotwell St. in SF. My friend Art called it &#8216;easter-egging.&#8217; I don&#8217;t think a 10 year old could have access to as many vacuum tubes as one would need to do this stuff. I know I didn&#8217;t and I was 17. Art and I would just go buy what we thought we might need. Art was pretty good at diagnosing a problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nolan also stated (in his June 6 e-mail) in relation to Ted&#8217;s claim on creating the spot motion circuitry prototype:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So according to you Ted, you calculated the clock frequency, designed the clock circuit, designed the counter circuits and the boolean logic for creating the sync. Then the motion circuits and graphic manipulations so that a Rocket could be displayed. And basically did it all while I was bouncing off the walls thinking about pizza parlors. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>To which Ted had also responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where you come up with this stuff that you say I said. What I said was that I bread-boaded a circuit that did digitally that which you wanted to do when you noticed that the v-hold on a TV could make the video move. I also said that I had to explain to you why the TV did that. That&#8217;s all I said and it is totally true. Way before any of this video game stuff came up, you and I were running around to restaurants and taverns to see how to create your idea of a game-playing establishment. Your whole total focus was on that project. Video games weren&#8217;t even a glimmer.</p>
<p>I feel, from your remarks, that you think I&#8217;m bitter over all that&#8217;s happened. I am not. I know that you are telling people that the only reason that I&#8217;m saying what I&#8217;m saying is because I&#8217;m bitter. Quite the contrary, I am now, and will always be, extremely grateful to you for me being a part of this great adventure. I am also grateful for the recognition that I am now getting. Selling to Warner was your choice. Getting rid or me was also your choice. Any animus is on your side only.</p>
<p>Two things that you and I both know: 1) you never repaired television sets and 2) you never had a notebook on your ideas for video games. Saying this kind of stuff is self-defeating. But unfortunately, you have become addicted to it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion to the television repair claim, upon further checking we noticed this particular back story about repairing TV&#8217;s first started turning up in interviews in 2009 about a month after the release of Leonard Herman&#8217;s groundbreaking first article on Ted and his contributions to<em> Computer Space</em> and Atari. (<em>Edge</em> #200, April 2009). Specifically, the article is the first to present Ted&#8217;s version of the events including his creation of the original spot-motion circuitry used in <em>Computer Space</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a timing that comes off as far more than coincidental given the above, and brings us back to the original topic of this post. Nolan is simultaneously the most inspiring and the most frustrating of people. Inspiring because of his vision and all that he was able to accomplish with Atari. Frustrating because of all the stories and tall tales (&#8220;waxing philosophical&#8221; as Al Alcorn and Steve Bristow have put it) that he&#8217;s in turn surrounded these accomplishments with. Once again, our process of research has been entirely neutral. If a story turned out to be true, then great. If it didn&#8217;t, great as well. Nolan has a lot to be proud of, and we&#8217;re certainly thankful to him and his role with starting Atari with Ted and everything he accomplished through Atari. We have no animosity towards him what so ever, and remain fans of all things Atari &#8211; including Nolan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest questions we get asked by readers after they see the wealth of information we packed into a single book, is how did we wade through it all? How did we decide what was factual enough to include and what else was just a good story? That in turn leads us to another misconception we&#8217;ve heard from some: that because some of co-founder Nolan Bushnell&#8217;s past stories and versions of events did not make it in to the book, that he was never interviewed. Nothing could be further from the truth of course, they just simply didn&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny as you&#8217;ll see in the later example in this post.<span id="more-169"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-66" alt="insightslogo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/insightslogo-300x142.png" width="300" height="142" />First and foremost, let me say that we have the up-most respect for every person who made Atari what it was, and always conducted ourselves with the up-most professionalism while conducting interviews and when later reviewing information for validation. Our goal with <em>Atari Inc. &#8211; Business Is Fun</em> was to get as accurate an accounting as humanly possible, because the fans of the brand demanded it. This meant following a rigid process for everyone we interviewed across the board, no matter how high or low on the corporate totem they were. That process was:</p>
<p>1) Information needed to be corroborated by at least one to two other sources. That source could be an interview with someone else, an internal memo, an engineering log, an internal email we have a log of, other paperwork, etc.</p>
<p>2) When interviewing others, we were very careful not to &#8220;lead the witness&#8221; or produce cross-contamination. That meant not trying to ask &#8220;Is it true such and such happened,&#8221; or &#8220;So and so said&#8230;&#8221; but rather allow them to bring it up themselves to produce a blind validation. If the subject never came up and we had to introduce it to the conversation (which happened once in a great while), it was asked in as minimal a manner as possible. Such as &#8220;We heard you guys tried to tie up multiple chip sources to block out competitors. Can you elaborate on this?&#8221;</p>
<p>3) In the case that we couldn&#8217;t find corroboration but the information seemed plausible, we included it in the book with &#8220;According to&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>4) In the case where it was not only uncorroborated, but refuted by other verifiable sources, we did not include it.</p>
<p>5) Before publication we also gave people we interviewed a chance to read over the book sections that cover them. They were given the chance to elaborate, contest, or confirm the material. In cases where we had something wrong, we corrected the info (after repeating the previous four steps). If the contested material simply did not vet because of the previous four steps, we discussed it with the subject and showed why, giving them a chance to further respond. (For the bulk of the material in the book it rarely had to go this far).</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adventurepromo.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-177" alt="adventurepromo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/adventurepromo-224x300.png" width="224" height="300" /></a>Let me tell you right now, without all the resources listed in step 1, this book would have never been possible (or would have been a very different book &#8211; probably much more in line with earlier efforts to chronicle Atari). We can&#8217;t thank ex-Atari employees enough for their generosity in time and resources. Many sent us their engineering logs and business diaries they&#8217;ve held on to all these years, along with other paperwork, notebooks, diagrams and other mementos. The people we interviewed were also always available for us via phone and email to ask further questions (and in many cases I&#8217;m sure annoy them) in an attempt to clarify events.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the large personal expenses of Curt and myself as we gathered further resources, such as additional internal documentation we paid for, legal document copies that were paid for, original backup tapes from Atari&#8217;s own mainframes (including internal emails, development directories, and more), prototypes, engineering diagrams, original artwork, press materials, paraphernalia and more. (All the material collected for this book is now part of the Atari Museum, an unprecedented archive of material belonging to Atari Inc.and Atari Corporation. Scott Evans&#8217; collection of material from Atari Inc.&#8217;s and and Atari Games&#8217; coin-op related history is the only other substantial collection of related material out there).</p>
<p>Though there were some high profile stories we certainly wanted to get to the bottom of, we did not set out to specifically debunk anyone or attempt to show them in a negative light. We approached everyone, no matter their position at Atari, with the same neutrality and initial acceptance of their graciously contributed stories and time. But as with many personal stories that people were asked to recount 20-some to 40 years after the fact, the facts weren&#8217;t always crystal clear &#8211; nor did they always hold up to the scrutiny mentioned above.</p>
<h2>A first example</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-185" alt="ray kassar" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ray-kassar-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" />As an initial example, we were told a story by Ray Kassar that he had meetings with Steve Jobs in 1979 to have Atari buy Apple. He stated it got far enough that he proposed it to Warner Communications head Steve Ross (because Warner would need to fund it), who then nixed it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we could not find supporting documentation or anyone else that had heard of the event, including the Warner Communications liaison to Atari, Manny Gerard. As the person in charge of overseeing Atari for Warner, Manny stated quite emphatically it never happened or he would have been a part of it, as Ray reported directly to him. He further stated that neither did his direct boss, Steve Ross, ever state anything about it to him.</p>
<p>This normal process chain is verifiable: You see, Manny&#8217;s job as Co-President of Warner Communications was to oversee Atari for Warner, and help guide the important subsidiary. A position and task easily verifiable by newspaper and magazine articles from the time, as well as interviews with other Atari Inc. management. Likewise, in further research we saw that Steve Ross didn&#8217;t circumvent Manny and get directly involved with Atari until things started crashing down in late &#8217;82. Even when things were bad in &#8217;78 and Nolan was declaring the 2600 dead, Steve Ross deferred to Manny and his decision on the matter as the person who was supposed to have his thumb on the pulse of Atari for Warner. And it was Manny who oversaw the putting of Nolan and others &#8220;on the beach&#8221; and the moving of Joe Keenan to Chairman of the Board and Ray to President of Atari in January 1979. Hitting a dead end on the validity of the story and seeing the plausibility in question in light of these facts, we decided not to include it in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Part II of this topic will be up later this week, centering around &#8220;When did Nolan Bushnell see Spacewar! for the first time&#8221; as another example of the process. </em></p>
